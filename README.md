# Plant-Species-Identification
Plant identification usually involves four steps, ie image acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. In this study, images from Swedish leaf dataset have been used, which contains 1,125 images of 15 different species.
 to identify images on your camera and gain more information about landmarks, places, plants, animals, products, and other objects. In a manual identification process, botanist use different plant characteristics as identification keys, which are examined sequentially and adaptively to identify plant species. In essence, a user of an identification key is answering a series of questions about one or more attributes of an unknown plant (e.g., shape, color, number of petals, existence of thorns or hairs) continuously focusing on the most discriminating characteristics and narrowing down the set of candidate species. This series of answered questions leads eventually to the desired species. However, the determination of plant species from field observation requires a substantial botanical expertise, which puts it beyond the reach of most nature enthusiasts. Traditional plant species identification is almost impossible for the general public and challenging even for professionals that deal with botanical problems daily, such as, conservationists, farmers, foresters, and landscape architects.
